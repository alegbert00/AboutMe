# About Me
Hey there! I'm a student at Truman State University studying Business Administration.  I have an interest in Data Analtics and plan to pursue the field. I enjoy the process involved, finding both problem-solving and pattern identifying satsifying. I enjoy the process of learning and mastering new tools and techniques.  Additionally, the evolving nature of the field ensures that there is always something new to learn, which keeps me engaged and motivated. I discovered the field while studying Marketing and the statistics involved in leading the decision making process.
