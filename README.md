# About Me
Hey there! I'm a student at Truman State University studying Business Administration.  

I have an interest in Data Analtics and am pursuing the field. I enjoy the process of learning and mastering new tools and techniques.  The evolving nature of the field ensures that there is always something new to learn, which keeps me engaged and motivated. I discovered the field while studying Marketing and the statistics involved in leading the decision making process. 

I have several projects under my belt that utilized various programming languages and statistical software to organize and find answers to business questions. I am a skilled presenter, something I have found very useful when I am presenting the findings of my projects. Additionally, I have history in Computer Science and Biology, which have led me to a well-rounded backgrounded in research, statistics, and tech.

This github is an ongoing collections of some of my projects including their code, findings, and presentation materials.
